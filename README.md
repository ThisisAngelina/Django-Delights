## Project Overview

The Django Delights system provides a web interface where restaurant staff can:

- Track the **inventory** of ingredients, including their quantity and price.
- Manage **menu items**, with each item requiring specific ingredients and quantities.
- Log **purchases**, automatically updating the inventory based on the items sold.
- View **profit and loss reports** for the restaurant, calculated by comparing revenue from purchases and costs of ingredients.

The project consists of two main apps:
1. **Inventory**: Handles the core business logic (inventory, menu items, purchases).
2. **Authenticate**: Manages user authentication (login and logout).

### Features

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - View a list of all ingredients, including available quantities and prices.
   - Add and update ingredients manually (e.g., when ingredients go bad or when new supplies are received).

2. **Menu Management**:
   - View the list of menu items along with their prices.
   - Add new menu items, specifying the required ingredients and quantities for each.
   - Update existing menu items and adjust the required ingredients.

3. **Purchases Management**:
   - Log new purchases, with automatic deductions of ingredient quantities based on recipe requirements.
   - Display a history of purchases including the purchase date, total cost, and items purchased.

4. **Profit and Loss Calculation**:
   - Monthly profit and loss reports based on the sales and ingredient costs for the current year.
   - Reports are displayed on the home page, showing revenue, expenses, and profits.

5. **User Authentication**:
   - The system requires users to log in to access features.
   - Only authenticated users can view and modify data.
   - Pre-configured credentials:
     - **Username**: delights_owner
     - **Password**: owner0000
